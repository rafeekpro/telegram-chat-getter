# Issue Start

Begin work on a GitHub issue with parallel agents based on work stream analysis.

## Usage
` ``
/pm:issue-start <issue_number>
` ``

## Quick Check

1. **Get issue details:**
   ` ``bash
   gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --json state,title,labels,body
   ` ``
   If it fails: "❌ Cannot access issue #$ARGUMENTS. Check number or run: gh auth login"

2. **Find local task file:**
   - First check if `.claude/epics/*/$ARGUMENTS.md` exists (new naming)
   - If not found, search for file containing `github:.*issues/$ARGUMENTS` in frontmatter (old naming)
   - If not found: "❌ No local task for issue #$ARGUMENTS. This issue may have been created outside the PM system."

3. **Check for analysis (when NOT using --analyze flag):**
   - If user didn't use `--analyze` flag, check if analysis file exists
   - Analysis file location: `.claude/epics/{epic_name}/$ARGUMENTS-analysis.md`
   - If no analysis AND no `--analyze` flag: Stop and suggest using `--analyze` flag

## Required Documentation Access

**MANDATORY:** Before starting work on issues, query Context7 for best practices:

**Documentation Queries:**
- `mcp://context7/agile/issue-planning` - Issue planning and breakdown
- `mcp://context7/tdd/workflow` - Test-Driven Development workflow
- `mcp://context7/git/branching` - Git branching strategies
- `mcp://context7/collaboration/parallel-work` - Parallel development patterns

**Why This is Required:**
- Ensures work follows current TDD best practices
- Applies proven patterns for parallel development
- Validates task coordination strategies
- Prevents common pitfalls in distributed work

## ⚠️ TDD REMINDER - READ THIS FIRST

**CRITICAL: This project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD).**

Before ANY coding work begins, you MUST follow the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle:

1. **RED Phase**: Write failing test that describes the desired behavior
2. **GREEN Phase**: Write minimum code to make test pass
3. **REFACTOR Phase**: Clean up code while keeping tests green

**For this issue:**
- Read the task requirements from the task file
- Identify what tests are needed BEFORE any implementation
- All agents must start with test creation
- No implementation without tests first

See `.claude/rules/tdd.enforcement.md` for complete TDD requirements.

## Instructions

### 0. Handle --analyze Flag (if provided)

If user provided `--analyze` flag, delegate to the Node.js script:
` ``bash
node packages/plugin-pm/scripts/pm/issue-start.cjs $ARGUMENTS --analyze
` ``

This script will:
1. Find the task file for the issue
2. Generate analysis file with parallel work streams
3. Create workspace structure
4. Launch parallel agents based on analysis
5. Handle all subsequent steps automatically

**STOP HERE** if using `--analyze` flag - the script handles everything.

---

### 1. Ensure Branch Exists (Non-analyze workflow)

Check if epic branch exists:
` ``bash
# Find epic name from task file
epic_name={extracted_from_path}

# Check branch
if ! git branch -a | grep -q "epic/$epic_name"; then
  echo "❌ No branch for epic. Run: /pm:epic-start $epic_name"
  exit 1
fi

# Check out the branch
git checkout epic/$epic_name
git pull origin epic/$epic_name
` ``

### 2. Read Analysis

Read `.claude/epics/{epic_name}/$ARGUMENTS-analysis.md`:
- Parse parallel streams
- Identify which can start immediately
- Note dependencies between streams

### 3. Setup Progress Tracking

Get current datetime: `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`

Create workspace structure:
` ``bash
mkdir -p .claude/epics/{epic_name}/updates/$ARGUMENTS
` ``

Update task file frontmatter `updated` field with current datetime.

### 4. Launch Parallel Agents

For each stream that can start immediately:

Create `.claude/epics/{epic_name}/updates/$ARGUMENTS/stream-{X}.md`:
` ``markdown
---
issue: $ARGUMENTS
stream: {stream_name}
agent: {agent_type}
started: {current_datetime}
status: in_progress
---

# Stream {X}: {stream_name}

## Scope
{stream_description}

## Files
{file_patterns}

## Progress
- Starting implementation
` ``

Launch agent using Task tool:
` ``yaml
Task:
  description: "Issue #$ARGUMENTS Stream {X}"
  subagent_type: "{agent_type}"
  prompt: |
    **🚨 CRITICAL RULE #1: Test-Driven Development (TDD) is MANDATORY**

    You MUST follow the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle:
    1. **RED**: Write a FAILING test first that describes the desired behavior
    2. **GREEN**: Write MINIMUM code to make the test pass
    3. **REFACTOR**: Clean up code while keeping all tests green

    **NO CODE WITHOUT TESTS FIRST.** Zero exceptions.
    - Every function starts with a test
    - Every bug fix starts with a test that reproduces it
    - Every feature starts with failing acceptance tests

    See `.claude/rules/tdd.enforcement.md` for complete requirements.

    ---

    **CRITICAL RULE #2: This project uses 'Docker-first development'.**
    - All commands (dependency installation, tests, running the application) MUST be executed inside a Docker container using `docker compose run --rm <service_name> <command>`.
    - DO NOT run `npm`, `pip`, `pytest`, etc., directly on the host.
    - The source code is mounted as a VOLUME, so file changes will be immediately visible in the container (hot-reloading).
    - Full rules can be found in `.claude/rules/docker-first-development.md`.

    You are working on Issue #$ARGUMENTS in the epic branch.

    Branch: epic/{epic_name}
    Your stream: {stream_name}
    
    Your scope:
    - Files to modify: {file_patterns}
    - Work to complete: {stream_description}
    
    Requirements:
    1. Read full task from: .claude/epics/{epic_name}/{task_file}
    2. **START WITH TESTS**: Write failing tests BEFORE any implementation
    3. Work ONLY in your assigned files
    4. Follow TDD cycle: RED (test fails) → GREEN (minimal code) → REFACTOR (cleanup)
    5. Commit frequently with format: "Issue #$ARGUMENTS: {specific change}"
    6. Update progress in: .claude/epics/{epic_name}/updates/$ARGUMENTS/stream-{X}.md
    7. Follow coordination rules in /rules/agent-coordination.md
    
    If you need to modify files outside your scope:
    - Check if another stream owns them
    - Wait if necessary
    - Update your progress file with coordination notes
    
    Complete your stream's work and mark as completed when done.

### 5. GitHub Assignment

` ``bash
# Assign to self and mark in-progress
gh issue edit $ARGUMENTS --add-assignee @me --add-label "in-progress"
` ``

### 6. Output

` ``
✅ Started parallel work on issue #$ARGUMENTS

Epic: {epic_name}
Worktree: ../epic-{epic_name}/

Launching {count} parallel agents:
  Stream A: {name} (Agent-1) ✓ Started
  Stream B: {name} (Agent-2) ✓ Started
  Stream C: {name} - Waiting (depends on A)

Progress tracking:
  .claude/epics/{epic_name}/updates/$ARGUMENTS/

⚠️  TDD CHECKLIST - All agents MUST follow:
  1. ❌ RED: Write failing test
  2. ❌ GREEN: Make test pass (minimal code)
  3. ❌ REFACTOR: Clean up code

Monitor with: /pm:epic-status {epic_name}
Sync updates: /pm:issue-sync $ARGUMENTS
` ``

## Error Handling

If any step fails, report clearly:
- "❌ {What failed}: {How to fix}"
- Continue with what's possible
- Never leave partial state

## Important Notes

Follow `/rules/datetime.md` for timestamps.
Keep it simple - trust that GitHub and file system work.
